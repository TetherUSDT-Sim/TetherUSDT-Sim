  <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #444; max-width: 900px;">
    TetherUSDT-Simulated is an academic blockchain project created to simulate the mechanisms of fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDT. It was launched for research and educational purposes and does not represent a real-world asset or hold any fiat backing.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #444; max-width: 900px;">
    This simulation allows researchers, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts to analyze how stablecoins operate, how they manage token issuance, and how they interact with decentralized environments. Our mission is to promote transparent learning and experimentation through real-code examples and blockchain integration.
