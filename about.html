    <p>
      TetherUSDT-Simulated is an academic blockchain project created to simulate the mechanisms of fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDT. It was launched for research and educational purposes and does not represent a real-world asset or hold any fiat backing.

    <p>
      This simulation allows researchers, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts to analyze how stablecoins operate, how they manage token issuance, and how they interact with decentralized environments.

    <p>
      Our mission is to promote transparent learning and experimentation through real-code examples and blockchain integration.
