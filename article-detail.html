    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This article explores the concept of simulated stablecoins in blockchain research, how they help in understanding token economics, and their importance in academic settings. Using TetherUSDT-Simulated as a case study, we delve into how such tokens can support educational efforts without involving real-world risks.</p>

    <h2>What are Simulated Stablecoins?</h2>
    <p>Simulated stablecoins are blockchain-based tokens that mimic the behavior of real-world stablecoins like USDT but are used solely for research, testing, or academic purposes. These tokens are not backed by real fiat currencies and are often deployed on testnets or using limited-value mainnets like BSC with clear disclaimers.</p>

    <h2>Why We Created TetherUSDT-Simulated</h2>
    <p>The TetherUSDT-Simulated project was initiated as part of a university research project to analyze how stablecoins operate, how they maintain peg, and what smart contract mechanisms are used for minting, burning, and transferring tokens.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases in Education</h2>
    <p>Simulated tokens allow students and researchers to interact with real smart contract infrastructure, wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask, and understand DeFi tools without any risk of loss. This hands-on experience is crucial in today’s fast-evolving crypto landscape.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As blockchain adoption grows, tools like TetherUSDT-Simulated provide a bridge between theory and practice. We hope this project becomes a reference point for future educational simulations in the decentralized finance space.</p>
